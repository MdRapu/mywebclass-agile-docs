# Task Title: "Create Slides for 10 Different Keybaord Shortcuts"

**User Story:** As a student, I want to be able to use the "Ctrl + C" and "Ctrl + V" shortcuts so that I can quickly copy and paste text in my school assignments, saving me time and reducing errors.

**Description**: Create a set of presentation slides explaining basic shortcuts, (such as "Ctrl + C" and "Ctrl + V" shortcuts) including their purpose, how to use them, and examples of when they are useful. The slides should be visually appealing and easy to understand for young learners. The acceptance criteria are that the slides are completed and reviewed by the team before being added to the presentation. The task depends on having access to the relevant software and knowledge of basic presentation design.
